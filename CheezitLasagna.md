<ol>
<li> If using frozen potatoes, begin thawing.
<li> In a bread machine set to mix, combine the cheddar for the dough, butter, and salt until soft and homogeneous.
<li> Add flower and mix on a low speed. Expect the dough to be dry and probably.

<li> Pat the dough into a disk, wrap with plastic wrap, and cool in a refrigerator for at least an hour.
<li> Preheat the oven to 375°F.
<li> Roll the dough until it is slightly more than 1/8 of an inch thick.
<li> Liberally grease a Pyrex baking dish with butter.
<li> Transfer the rolled dough to the baking dish. Make sure to line the edges. Fold some dough over the edge for support.
<li> Bake the dish for 15 minutes.
<li> Add the adobo to the potatoes and mix well.
<li> While the dish is baking, fry the potatoes until browned in a skillet.
<li> Remove the dish from the oven.
<li> Place the potatoes inside the crusted dish.
<li> Cover the top of the potatoes with the remaining cheese. Add any additional toppings now.
